//A college offers a course that prepares students for the state licensing exam for real-estate
//        brokers. Last year, ten of the students who completed this course took the exam. The col-
//        lege wants to know how well its students did on the exam. You’ve been asked to write a
//        program to summarize the results. You’ve been given a list of these 10 students. Next to
//        each name is written a 1 if the student passed the exam or a 2 if the student failed.
//        Your program should analyze the results of the exam as follows:
//        1. Input each test result (i.e., a 1 or a 2). Display the message “Enter result” on the screen
//        each time the program requests another test result.
